# TEST DOCUMENTATION 

This repository contains complete QA documentation for testing an **online store project**.  
It covers all key testing stages — from planning and creating checklists to reporting defects and performing a final test run.


[Check-list Online Store](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uld1bkUVeYDzeNvp-zaeqCXwIfcV9QO0WcP5vs_xfE8/edit?usp=sharing) — structured list of test scenarios for major modules:  
  registration, login, product catalog, cart, sorting, and filtering.  
  Each case is linked to specific user stories and includes both positive and negative tests.

[Test suites- Registration, Authorization and Product Catalog.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22061659/Test.suites-.Registration.and.Authorization.and.Product.Catalog.pdf) —  
  grouped test cases for validating user flow logic and data consistency across main store modules.

[Bug Reposts Online Store](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NukN1aymhwMI0XR7xmHDqlVp8O3fBoRZi13u4yccLng/edit?usp=sharing) — table of discovered defects with detailed steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results, and linked user stories.


[Test Run_Registration_and_Autorization_Online_Store.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22212314/Test.Run_Registration_and_Autorization_Online_Store.pdf) — final test execution report exported from **Qase.io**, summarizing results and defect statuses after regression.
